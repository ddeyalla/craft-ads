## üö¶ Project Progress

**Overall Completion: ~15-20%**

-   **Core Functionality:** Basic ad generation (title + desc + image ‚Üí copy + edited image) is implemented.
-   **Image Handling:** Image upload via dropzone, processing with Sharp, and storage in Supabase are functional.
-   **UI Foundation:** Using shadcn/ui components for the interface.
-   **Next Steps:** Focus on fixing the ad library display, implementing multi-copy/ratio/theme features, database integration, and authentication.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    cd vibecode-ad-generator
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or yarn install or pnpm install
    ```
3.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    -   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory.
    -   Add the following variables (get values from your service dashboards):
        ```env
        # OpenAI
        OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

        # Supabase
        NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://<your-project-ref>.supabase.co
        NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<your-anon-key>
        # Add SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY if needed for backend operations

        # Sentry (Optional - based on package.json)
        # SENTRY_DSN=...
        # NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN=...
        ```
4.  **Set up Supabase:**
    -   Ensure you have a Supabase project created.
    -   Create a Storage bucket (e.g., `generated-ads`) and set appropriate public access policies (e.g., allow anonymous SELECT and authenticated INSERT).
    -   If moving data to DB, set up required tables (e.g., `products`, `ads`, `users`).
5.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.
